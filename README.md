"Examples make everything better"

## Q. What if you could supplement documentation with different types of examples?
goldieDocs aims to be a crowd sourced respository. Providing examples of JavaScript features in various formats (code snippet, GIF, text etc.).

## Getting started
Starting small, we'll work towards creating examples to supplement the awesome [JavaScript for Cats](http://jsforcats.com/) and once we're on a roll, work up to the [MDN References](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference).

## Data Structure ideas

```
// var.js
 export[
  { type: "code", content: `example ${snippet}`},
  { type: "gif", content: `example ${url}`},
  { type: "text", content: `example ${text}`}
 ]
 
 definitions()
 renderDefinition()

```
